The shared memory tests do not cleanup the shared memory segments or named pipes. Run the following after each test.
ipcrm -M 0x00001388
rm /tmp/*.db

allocator_shm: Test the shared memory allocator. Rremove shared memory segment before running. ( ipcrm -M 0x00001388 )
allocator_malloc: Heap allocator that is used to test memory allocation algorithms. The allocator_shm and allocator_malloc
                  are really identical, except that allocator_shm uses semaphores.
logger : This method starts a client process and sends messages to the logger parent.
offset_ptr : This tests the offset pointer logic used to ensure that all objects in the allocator are located by offsets.
reactor : Test starting a child process and sending an event to the parent child. The reactor will handle it.
reactor_notify: Test the reactor notifications.
reactor_signal: Test the reactor signal handling.
reactor_timer: Test the reactor timers.
shared_in_list: Test the intrusive list stored in shared memory. The linkage is stored as well.
shared_queue: Test a queue in shared memory. This is analgous to the message queue in linux.



















TODO

1. Consolidate the allocators to use inheritence. There is alot of redundant code between the two.
2. Fix the memove of shm allocator to the heap. This test should be used to validate all relative pointer. For some reason the registered objects
   are not being moved correctly? This works for allocator_malloc? Not sure why.
