1. Need to add destroy to shared objects. Life-cycle currently not working.
2. Add policy to process manager. RESTART, RESTART_DELAY
3. Add coalesce to allocators.
4. Add buddy allocator.
5. Implement deregister object in allocator.
6. remove all upcalls to user functions from shared memory ( i.e for_each, etc. ). This creates issues with semaphores.
